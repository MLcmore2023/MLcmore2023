    "- Flexibility: JSON supports complex data structures, including nested objects and arrays, making it suitable for semi-structured and hierarchical datasets.\n",
    "- Human-Readable: JSON is easy to understand and interpret by both humans and machines due to its simple and intuitive syntax.\n",
    "- Data Transmission: JSON is commonly used for data transmission between different systems and programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased File Size: Compared to other file formats like CSV, JSON files tend to have a larger file size due to their expanded structure, which can impact storage and transmission efficiency.\n",
    "- Slower Processing: Parsing and processing JSON files can be slower compared to more structured file formats, especially for large datasets."
